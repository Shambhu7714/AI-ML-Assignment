      As a part of the assessment i am analyse the logs from and build analytics solutions 
      when does the person work-out, how many steps he took on daily basis, what are his active times etc. 
      The more analytics you generate better it will be for evaluation. Analytics should have better visualisation in form of graphs.
      Using Python.
